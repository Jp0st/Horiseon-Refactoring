# <Your-Project-Title>
Module 1 Horiseon Code Refactor
## Description

I updated the HTML code to make it both cleaner and more understandable in order to match accessibility standards.  I also updated the CSS code to match the changes made in the HTML and did work to make it both more originized and efficient.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

The updated HTML and CSS files in this repository can serve as examples in refactoring code to update HTML accessibility without changing the look or function of the webpage.  The HTML uses proper semantic elements to define different aspects of the page while the CSS more effectively groups sections together with the same style formatting. 

## Credits

The unedited code for the webpage can be found in this repository here : [https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/urban-octo-telegram]

I also referenced this HTML guide to learn about the different semantic elements available : [https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp]
